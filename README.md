# Digital Audio Workstations
For my first milestone project, I chose to create a website containing information on digital audio workstations and different software available to allow a user to start recording high quality audio from their home. I have listed the requirements neccessary for a user to make use of this method of recording and enhancing their audio.<br> 
The site also has some information on audio post production tools contained within the software programs which will allow a user to enhance the audio quality of their recordings after the audio is recorded.<br>
## UX
This website is aimed at people who are interested in learning about recording audio from their home and the process involved to enhance the audio quality of their recordings after they have recorded their audio.<br> 
As a user, I want to find out about some software available for download to allow me to make good quality home audio recordings. As a user, I want to find out about the requirements neccessary to make use of such software. As a user, I want to ascertain information on commonly used tools found within the sotfware programs to make the audio sound better and learn what these tools do to the recorded audio when applied.ed<br>
I have created wireframes for each of the pages and have included them in a wireframe folder within the project. These wireframes are titled "page1.png","page2.png" and "page3.png". As I progressed throughout the project I changed the images for certain parts of the pages but kept the page layout template I created within the wireframes.<br>
## Features
### Navbar
I have created a navigation bar which consists of three clickable page headings which are "Home", "Equalization" and "Compressor/Limiter". The currently selected page becomes highlighted and the pages that arent selected appear darker. In addition to the page headings I have included a font awesome icon of a headphone in the navigation bar <br>
I have incorporated javascript into the navbar by allowing a navbar toggler button to appear in place of the menu headings which contains the nav headings once the screen is at a certain width to incorporate some responsive design into the project<br>
The navbar and the image directly below the navbar are both common features on all the pages included in the project.<br>
### Home Page
The home page on the site consists of an explanation of what a digital audio workstation is. Also included in this section are a few examples of the existing software available accompanied by pictures of the software logos. Each software icon logo is a link to that particular softwares website which gives information on the features available in that particular software.<br>
Below this, I have listed the requirements neccessary to start producing high quality home audio. These requirement sections consist of computers, audio interfaces and microphones with pictures of each component beside their text areas.<br>
Found within the computer section is a list of hyperlinks for both apple and windows computers which give details of the computer specifications required to run the software. I have included font awesome icons for both apple and windows symbols which accompany the text stating what each link is for. This is to help the user decide on which audio interface would be best suited for them.<br>
Found within the audio interface section is a hyperlink to a website which gives a list of some of the best audio interfaces available in 2019.<br>
Found within the microphone section is a hyperlink to a website which gives a list of some of the best budget microphones available for home recording. This is to help the user choose which microphone to buy which would be best suited to them.
### Equalization Page
The Equalization page consists of an explanation of what EQ is and why it is important in audio production. I also give explanations on different types of Equalisers available accompanied with screenshots of the stock pro tools EQ plug ins available.
### Compressor/Limiter Page
The Compressor/Limiter page consists of an explanation of what both these tools do and why they are important in audio production with the explanations accompanied by screenshots for each audio tool.<br>
### Footer
The footer is common for every page of the project. It consists of links to websites that are well renowned for audio production advice and a copyright for the projects page.<br>
I have created icons for the links using font awesome icons for the website, facebook and youtube pages of each link related to it.If the user clicks on the facebook icon for a particular link, they will be taken to the pages facebook page. If a user clicks on the youtube icon for a link, they will be taken to the links youtube channel, If a user clicks on the internet icon for a link, they will be taken to the links website. These links change colour with a transition when the mouse hovers over them. The website icons colour will change to green, the facebook icons colour will change to blue and the youtube icons colour will change to red  <br>
