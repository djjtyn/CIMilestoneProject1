The dynamics of a recording are to do with the volumes of the audio. Both of the tools work by making the quieter parts of a recording louder and decreasing\n          the louder parts of the recording.For a further explanation of dynamics, see the video below:</p>\n        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4XWWpC88iw\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <hr>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-12\">\n        <h3>Compression</h3>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"compresstxt col-12 col-md-6\">\n        <!--Compression explanation taken from https://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-beginners-guide-to-compression-audio-953-->\n        <p>Compression is the process of lessening the dynamic range between the loudest and quietest parts of an audio signal. This is done by boosting the quieter signals and attenuating the louder signals. The controls you are given to set up a compressor\n          are usually:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Threshold - how loud the signal has to be before compression is applied.</li>\n          <li>Ratio - how much compression is applied. For example, if the compression ratio is set for 6:1, the input signal will have to cross the threshold by 6 dB for the output level to increase by 1dB.</li>\n          <li>Attack - how quickly the compressor starts to work.</li>\n          <li>Release - how soon after the signal dips below the threshold the compressor stops.</li>\n          <li>Knee - sets how the compressor reacts to signals once the threshold is passed. Hard Knee settings mean it clamps the signal straight away, and Soft Knee means the compression kicks in more gently as the signal goes further past the threshold.</li>\n          <li>Make-Up Gain - allows you to boost the compressed signal. as compression often attenuates the signal significantly.</li>\n          <li>Output - allows you to boost or attenuate the level of the signal output from the compressor.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-12 col-md-6 compresspic\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-12\">\n        <h3>Limiter</h3>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"row int\">\n      <div class=\"col-12 col-md-6 limiter\"></div>\n      <div class=\"col-12 col-md-6 limitertxt\">\n        <!--Limiter explanation taken from https://www.practical-music-production.com/audio-limiter/-->\n        <p>The audio limiter is a very similar tool to the audio compressor in that it reduces the dynamic range of a signal that passes through it. A compressor gradually reduces the signal level above a certain threshold, but a limiter completely prevents\n          a signal from going over a specified setting – a limit that nothing can go over.</p>\n        <p>You can set the limiter so that it catches and prevents any of the signal from clipping and distorting – it’s a very useful way to ensure your recording signal doesn’t go ‘into the red’.</p>\n        <p>The ratio setting on an audio limiter (also known as a sound limiter) is usually set at 20:1 or higher, going up to infinity:1 (∞:1). This is the biggest difference you’ll find between a compressor and a limiter.</p>\n        <p>An audio limiter is most commonly used at the mastering stage of a record, where the limiter is used as the last processing device across the whole mix. The ratio is fixed at ∞:1 – this means that as soon as the signal hits the specified ceiling\n          level, it cannot go any higher. This is also known as ‘brick wall limiting‘.</p>\n        <p>A mastering engineer will use a limiter to boost the overall level of a finished track or album, and to squeeze as much volume out as possible. But it’s important to point out that the qualities of the sound are not affected – the only difference\n          is in the perceived loudness of the track that you hear being raised.</p>\n
